        <p><span class="first-character sc">I</span>Alaska, often referred to as "The Last Frontier," is a land of immense beauty and boundless opportunities for adventure. As the largest state in the United States, both in area and in natural grandeur, Alaska captivates the imagination of explorers, nature lovers, and those seeking a life off the beaten path. With its dramatic landscapes, rich cultural heritage, and abundant wildlife, Alaska holds a unique place in the hearts of all who experience its wonders.

        <p class="margin-top-10">Alaska is an awe-inspiring region, covering over 1.7 million square kilometers. It boasts diverse geographical features, from towering mountains and expansive tundras to vast forests and thousands of glistening glaciers. Among its crowning jewels is Denali, the highest peak in North America, standing at 20,310 feet. The state is bordered by Canada to the east,</p>

        <p><span class="first-character ny">B</span>Alaska is home to some of the world's tallest mountains, vast stretches of unspoiled wilderness, and nearly 100,000 glaciers—a top wishlist destination for many outdoor-loving families, mine included. When it came time to figure out how we were going to get around the nation’s largest state, a camping-filled road trip turned out to be the best option—in part because camping, where you wake up to breathtaking natural beauty and wildlife right outside your tent each morning, instantly makes you a cool parent in the years of your 17-year-old and 13-year-old. .</p>
        <p class="line-break margin-top-10"></p>
        <p class="margin-top-10">One of Alaska’s classic road trips is the 240-mile stretch from Anchorage to Denali National Park and Preserve. While it can be covered in about four hours, we took our time over five days. Below, an itinerary inspired by my family’s late summer travels when daylight lasts from 5 a.m. to 10 p.m., giving you plenty of time for multiple stops to soak in that Alaskan hospitality and charm. </p>
